There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.
What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.
The only joy in the world is to begin.
Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions.
To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.
